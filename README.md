## Content folders

1. Koboforms

Contains XML Forms with meta data for surveys. 

2. RShiny dashboard

`call_data.R` calls the kobocollect API, parses the JSON and tidys the data. 

The remaining scripts are for the RShiny dashboard, which lets user view and download data. 

Note: to run this code you will need to save a `login_creds.R` file. Contact me for username and password. The project is open source: anyone can fill in the forms or access the data.
